## About

**CoinPlot** is a simple and modern single-page web app for exchange rates visualization.

There are two versions of this project:

* `v2.x.x` _(discontinued, has a separate branch in the repo)_
    * Far more focus on extensibility and architecture
    * Multiple data providers
    * I18N
    * An attempt at in-memory DB caching
    * [Lots of verbose code documentation](https://github.com/northmaxdev/coinplot/blob/2.x.x/src/main/java/io/github/northmaxdev/coinplot/lang/math/Percentage.java)
* `v3.x.x`
    * Is all about KISS
    * Roughly 75% smaller codebase
    * Scrapped useless features
    * Optimized for a single locale; missing L10N implemented
